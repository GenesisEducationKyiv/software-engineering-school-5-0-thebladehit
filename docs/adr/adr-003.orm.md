**Status**: Accepted

**Author**: Bogdan Yarmolka

## Context
It is necessary to choose an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the PostgreSQL database in a type-safe, scalable, and developer-friendly way.
The ORM should support:
- TypeScript integration
- Migrations
- Relations and constraints

## Considered options
1. PrismaORM
- **Pros**: Type-safe queries; auto-generated types; good developer experience; strong documentation; easy schema management and migrations.
- **Cons**: Limited support for some advanced SQL features; requires a build step.

2. TypeORM
- **Pros**: Decorator-based; supports Active Record and Data Mapper; integrated with NestJS.
- **Cons**: Unstable in large projects; weaker type-safety.

3. Sequelize
- **Pros**: Mature; supports multiple databases; flexible.
- **Cons**: Weak TypeScript support; verbose; steeper learning curve.

## Decision
**Prisma** was chosen.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Excellent TypeScript support and auto-completion.
- Clear and declarative schema modeling.
- Simple and reliable migrations.
- Great developer experience and onboarding speed.

### Negative
- Limited dynamic query building capabilities.
- Requires additional build steps (prisma generate).
- Some raw SQL use may still be needed in edge cases.
